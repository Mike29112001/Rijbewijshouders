# Driving license holders and CBR pass rates (2024)
In this Notebook we analyze the number of driving license holders in the Netherlands over the past 10 years (2014-2024), divided over different vehicle categories. The data comes from the CBR (Central Bureau for Driving Licenses).

In addition, we compare the pass rates of the various practical exam locations of the CBR. We investigate which locations are considered difficult, average or relatively easy based on the results achieved.

These analyses provide insight into trends and regional differences in driving skills and exam results.
